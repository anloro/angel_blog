## General definitions
We need the mathematical background of *tensors*, *linear maps*, *vector spaces*, *coordinate frames*, *manifolds*, *groups* and *sets*, for so refer to the theoretical explanation [link](link!).

**Free vectors:** They are vectors that are NOT bound to an origin. These vectors are free to move around by parallel transport.

**Group**: Is a set M and an operation \* (it can be wathever operation, for example, the multiplication in the real numbers) that satisfies the properties:
1. *Associativity*: (m1\*m2)\*m3 = m1\*(m2\*m3), m1, m2 and m3 elements of M.
1. *Identity*: m\*I = I\*m = m, I is an element of M and m is any element of M.
1. *Inverse*: mm<sup>-1</sup> = I, where m<sup>-1</sup> exists.

**What is a Lie group?** A Lie-Group is a "manifold group" which tangent space at the identity is an algebra (has a skew symmetric operation) called Lie algebra.

*Skew symmetric*: If you take the transpose of a matrix the transpose is the minus the same matrix.

| R<sup>T</sup> = - R |

**Eucledian Space '𝜀<sub>\*</sub>':** Is a space of free vectors plus an *Inner Product*. Not all of the vector spaces have an inner product, and this structure it is very important, because with the inner product we can talk about orthogonality of vectors and absolute length of vectors.

*Inner Product*: Is an structure that given 2 vectors it returns a real number.<br>

| **<,>**: 𝜀<sub>\*</sub> x 𝜀<sub>\*</sub> → ℝ |

## Coordinate systems
A **coordinate system** *𝚿<sub>o</sub>* is composed of an origin '*o*' and 3 linear independent free vectors '*e<sub>i</sub>*':<br>

|𝚿<sub>o</sub> := (*o*, *e<sub>1</sub>*, *e<sub>2</sub>*, *e<sub>3</sub>*), 𝜖 𝜀(3) x 𝜀<sub>\*</sub>(3) x 𝜀<sub>\*</sub>(3) x 𝜀<sub>\*</sub>(3)|

And it is **orthonormal** if and only if the vectors defining it have length one and they are orthogonal. In other terms: \|\|e<sub>i</sub>\|\| = 1 ∀i and  <e<sub>i</sub>,e<sub>j</sub>> = 0 ∀i≠j.

The coordinates that we usually use are the representation of physical points by real numbers. This representation can be obtained in the following manner: 

Given a coordinate frame 𝚿<sub>i</sub> = (o<sub>i</sub>, ̂x<sub>i</sub>, ŷ<sub>i</sub>, ̂z<sub>i</sub>), and a physical point p, we can map the physical point as:

Coordinate map: 𝜓<sub>i</sub>: 𝜀(3) → ℝ<sup>3</sup>;<br>
Use of the map: p → (<(p-o<sub>i</sub>),x̂<sub>i</sub>>, 
                     <(p-o<sub>i</sub>),ŷ<sub>i</sub>>, 
                     <(p-o<sub>i</sub>),ẑ<sub>i</sub>>)

In other words, 𝜓<sub>i</sub> is a map from the Euclidean Space into the 3 dimensional real number space. It takes p and it substracts the origin of the coordinate frame *o<sub>i</sub>)*, and then uses the result (which pertains to 𝜀(3)) to perform the inner product whith each unitary vector of the coordinate frame. After this operation it obtains a 3 dimensional representation of *p*. 

It is possible to change between coordinate systems. To do this you first have to take inverse mapping from the current coordinate system and then apply the mapping to the desired coordinate system.

In other terms: p<sup>2</sup> = (𝜓<sub>2</sub> *o* 𝜓<sub>1</sub><sup>-1</sup>)(p<sup>1</sup>)<br>
Which maps: p<sup>1</sup> → p → p<sup>2</sup>

<u>Notation</u>: Note that we have a subindex and a supperindex, the subindex enumerates and the supperindex tells in which frame is represented the point. Then for p<sub>i</sub><sup>j</sup> is readen as point p number *i* expressed in frame *j*.

The **tilde operator** it is a very usefull notation that it is often used. Note that there are only n independent values, in this example 3.

## Rotations
Rotations are a very important concept in robotics. Imagine that you have a point *p* represented in a coordinate frame 𝜓<sub>1</sub>, and you want to represent the point on another coordinate frame 𝜓<sub>2</sub>, which has the same origin as the previous one but it is rotated a certain angle 𝜃.

To perform a 3D rotation of the form p<sup>2</sup> = R<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>p<sup>1</sup>, the following rotation matrix is computed:

As we only consider right-handed orthonormal frames, we have the following properties:
1. det(R<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>) = 1
1. R<sub>2</sub><sup>1</sup> = (R<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>)<sup>-1</sup> = (R<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>)<sup>T</sup>
1. The columms and row vectors of R<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> have length 1 and they are orthogonal.

Let's take out this definition for further reference. 
*Orthonormal matrix*: Is a square matrix such that:  

| R<sup>-1</sup> = R<sup>T</sup> |

### SO(3)
The group of 3 dimension orthonormal matrices with determinant +1 is called the **Special Orthonormal Group** of ℝ<sup>3</sup> or **SO(3)**, and can be defined in the following manner:

| SO(3) := { R 𝜖 ℝ<sup>3x3</sup>; R<sup>-1</sup> = R<sup>T</sup>, det(R) = 1} |

SO(3) is **a group and a manifold**.

It is a group because it satisfies the 3 properties:
- [x] Associativity.
- [x] Identity. The identity matrix.
- [x] Inverse. Because by definition all of the elements have an inverse.

It is a Lie group because: 
Given (R, dR) 𝜖 TSO(3), dR 𝜖 T<sub>R</sub>SO(3), R a rotation matrix, dR the derivative of R, T a tangent plane to SO(3), it satisfies the conditions:
- [x] *(L<sub>R<sup>-1</sup></sub>)<sub>\*</sub>(R, dR) = (R<sup>-1</sup>R, R<sup>-1</sup>dR) = (I, w̃<sub>L</sub>)  
w̃<sub>L</sub> 𝜖 T<sub>I</sub>SO(3) =: so(3)*
- [x] *(R<sub>R<sup>-1</sup></sub>)<sub>\*</sub>(R, dR) = (R<sup>-1</sup>R, R<sup>-1</sup>dR) = (I, w̃<sub>R</sub>)  
w̃<sub>R</sub> 𝜖 T<sub>I</sub>SO(3) =: so(3)*
- [x] **Lie bracket operation or commutator [ . , . ]**: *[w̃<sub>x</sub>, w̃<sub>y</sub>] := w̃<sub>x</sub>w̃<sub>y</sub> - w̃<sub>y</sub>w̃<sub>x</sub> 𝜖 so(3)*

Note that these properties of SO(3) tell us important information of this Lie Group, given (R, dR) if we operate on the left or in the right we obtain *w̃<sub>L</sub>* or *w̃<sub>R</sub>*, which are elements of so(3), at the identity element of SO(3). In other words, given any element R of SO(3) and its derivative, we can obtain *w̃* at the identity by multiplying by the inverse of R. This will prove to be very usefull.

### so(3)
Then we can define the algebra of this group as **so(3)**, which it is a vector space of the *w̃*  skew symmetric elements tangent to the identity element of SO(3). We have the following theorem:
If R(t) 𝜖 SO(3) is a differentiable function of time, dRR<sup>T</sup> and R<sup>T</sup>dR are Skew-Symmetric and belonging to so(3):

| *so(3) := { w̃ 𝜖 ℝ<sup>3x3</sup>; -w̃ = w̃<sup>T</sup> }*

so(3) is a Lie Algebra because:
- [x] so(3) is a vector space on its own.
- [x] It has the Lie bracket operation (satisfying the axioms of bilinearity, aternativity, Jacobi identity and anticommutativity [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra#Definitions)), from which 2 elements of so(3) are taken and the result is another element of so(3):

| [Ω<sub>1</sub>, Ω<sub>2</sub>] := Ω<sub>1</sub>Ω<sub>2</sub> - Ω<sub>2</sub>Ω<sub>1</sub> 𝜖 so(3) |

In addition: 
- The linear combination of skew-symmetric matrices is still skew-symmetric.
- To each Ω 𝜖 so(3) matrix we can associate a vector w 𝜖 ℝ<sup>3</sup> such that *w̃ = Ω*.

**Why is the Lie group structure so important?**
Because it makes possible to talk about motion w without knowing the pose R of the object.
We can also get rid off any dependency from the configuration. This is essential to talk about interconnection through Power Ports of bodies with different poses. 

*Dual space*: For any finite dimensional vector space we can define the space of linear operators from that space.

*The chain rule*: It is possible to decompose a rotation in several smaller rotations. 

| R<sub>1</sub><sup>n</sup> = R<sub>n-1</sub><sup>n</sup> ... R<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup>R<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>

## General motions
We can compute a general motion as p<sup>1</sup> = Ap<sup>2</sup> + B, but as we defined SO(3) we can use the elements of this group to perform an orthonormal change of coordinates. And then define the change of coordinate frame as:

| p<sup>j</sup> = R<sub>i</sub><sup>j</sup> p<sup>i</sup> + o<sub>i</sub><sup>j</sup> 

Where R<sub>i</sub><sup>j</sup> 𝜖 SO(3) rotation matrix, o<sub>i</sub><sup>j</sup> 𝜖 ℝ<sup>3</sup> the origin of coordinate frame i represented in terms of the frame j.
It is possible to see this transformation as a composed map from ℝ<sup>3</sup> to 𝜀<sub>\*</sub> and again to ℝ<sup>3</sup> defined like *𝜓<sub>j</sub> o 𝜓<sub>i</sub><sup>-1</sup>* : ℝ<sup>3</sup> → ℝ<sup>3</sup>.

With the elements of SO(3) it is easy to apply the chain rule but for general motions it is necessary to define an extra structure called **the homogeneous matrix**, which it is closely related to the configuration of rigid bodies. 

<table class="inline">
<td>
H<sub>i</sub><sup>j</sup> 
</td>
<td>
= 
</td>
<td>
     <table class="matrix">
          <tr>
               <td>R<sub>i</sub><sup>j</sup></td>
               <td>o<sub>i</sub><sup>j</sup></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
               <td>0</td>
               <td>1</td>
          </tr>
     </table>
</td>
</table>

And now we can also apply the chain rule:

| H<sub>i</sub><sup>k</sup> = H<sub>m</sub><sup>k</sup> H<sub>s</sub><sup>m</sup> ... H<sub>l</sub><sup>q</sup> H<sub>i</sub><sup>l</sup>

### SE(3)
The homogeneous matrices also form a group, the Special Euclidean group SE(3).

<table class="inline">
<td>
SE(3) := {
</td>
<td>
     <table class="matrix">
          <tr>
               <td>R</td>
               <td>o</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
               <td>0</td>
               <td>1</td>
          </tr>
     </table>
</td>
<td>
s.t R 𝜖 SO(3) , o 𝜖 ℝ<sup>3</sup> }
</td>
</table>

Because it satisfies:
- [x] Associativity.
- [x] Identity.
- [x] Inverse.

### se(3)
And this group has also an algebra. Similar to what it was defined for SO(3), if we have that H(t) 𝜖 SE(3) is a differentiable function of time then dHH<sup>-1</sup> and H<sup>-1</sup>dH belong to se(3) where:

<table class="inline">
<td>
se(3) := {
</td>
<td>
     <table class="matrix">
          <tr>
               <td><i>w̃</i></td>
               <td>v</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
               <td>0</td>
               <td>0</td>
          </tr>
     </table>
</td>
<td>
s.t <i>w̃</i> 𝜖 so(3) , v 𝜖 ℝ<sup>3</sup> }
</td>
</table>

Now define a new tilde operator, is like in programming to overload a function, here we overload the tilde operator. When the tilde operator is used on a 6 elements vector then we get a 4 by 4 matrix:

<table class="inline">
<td>
T := 
</td>
<td>
     <table class="matrix">
          <tr>
               <td>w</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
               <td>v</td>
          </tr>
     </table>
</td>
<td>
 ⟹ <i> ̃T</i> = 
</td>
<td>
     <table class="matrix">
          <tr>
               <td><i>w̃</i></td>
               <td>v</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
               <td>0</td>
               <td>0</td>
          </tr>
     </table>
</td>
<td>
 𝜖 se(3)
</td>
</table>

T represent the **Twists**, which are the representation of the rigid body velocities. It is important to say that w represent the commonly known rotational velocity, but v is not the linear velocity which it is commonly known.
